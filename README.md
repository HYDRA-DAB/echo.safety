# Echo - Campus Safety Platform

A platform designed for **SRM KTR University students**.  

Through an interactive **crime map**, incidents of womenâ€™s safety concerns, theft, and drug abuse are highlighted with **ripple markers** that spread like echoes of disturbance across and around the campus.  

Alongside a **live crime feed** and a **helpline directory**, Echo ensures that:  
- No incident goes unnoticed  
- No call for help goes unheard  
- Every student feels empowered to act against crime
